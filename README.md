# resilent_network-API-request-script
This Python script demonstrates how to combine structured logging with robust API request handling. It begins by configuring the logging module to record debug, info, warning, error, and critical messages into a file named log.txt, helping track program execution and issues. The fetch_api() function sends an HTTP GET request with a 3-second timeout and uses layered exception handling to manage common network problems such as request timeouts, unreachable hosts, HTTP status errors, and invalid or non-JSON responses. When the response is valid and contains proper JSON, it prints and returns the data; otherwise, meaningful error messages are displayed. The script tests three scenarios—a valid API endpoint, a nonexistent URL, and a URL returning HTML instead of JSON—demonstrating how the function reacts in different failure conditions. Overall, it provides a clear example of writing safer, more maintainable, and well-logged API scripts.
